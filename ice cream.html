<h1 class="h1">Ice cream</h1>
<p>Ice cream is a sweetened frozen food typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
     It may be made from milk or cream and is flavoured with a sweetener, either
    sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with 
    fruit such as strawberries or peaches. It can also be made by whisking a
    flavored cream base and liquid nitrogen together. Food coloring is sometimes
    added, in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled below the freezing
    point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and to prevent detectable
    ice crystals from forming. The result is a smooth, semi-solid foam that is
    solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F). It becomes more 
    malleable as its temperature increases.</p>

    The meaning of the name "ice cream" varies from one country to another.
     In some countries, such as the United States, "ice cream" applies only 
     to a specific variety, and most governments regulate the commercial use
    of the various terms according to the relative quantities of the main
    ingredients, notably the amount of cream.[1] Products that do not meet 
    the criteria to be called ice cream are sometimes labelled "frozen dairy
    dessert" instead.[2] In other countries, such as Italy and Argentina,
    one word is used for all variants. Analogues made from dairy alternatives,
    such as goat's or sheep's milk, or milk substitutes (e.g., soy, cashew, coconut,
    almond milk or tofu), are available for those who are lactose intolerant,
    allergic to dairy protein, or vegan.
